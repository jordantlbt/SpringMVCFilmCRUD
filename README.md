# SpringMVCFilmCRUD

## Overview
The SpringMVCFilmCRUD project was the first group project assigned in the SkillDistillery program. This application implemented full web-based C.R.U.D.(create, read, update, and delete) functionality, as well as, usage of Spring MVC(model-view-controller) and DAO(data access object) implementation using JDBC(java database connectivity).

When the application is ran, the user is directed to a webpage where they may enter a Film's unique ID or keyword that potentially matches with title or description in the database. After retrieving a film, they have options to edit or delete the film. The details retrieved by each film description also include information from actor and category tables.
